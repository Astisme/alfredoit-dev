## Who are you?
I'm Alfredo, a software developer with a passion for web development and project design.

I love to learn new things and to share my knowledge with others. I'm always looking for new challenges to improve myself, which is the reason why developing software is my job, but most importantly my lifestyle.

I am a employed at <Href href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/novareply/">Nova Reply</Href> which is the second company I work for after completing my studies at the <Href href="https://www.uniupo.it/en">University of Eastern Piedmont</Href>.

## What can you do?
I'm a full-stack developer who prefers to tinker more on the backend side.

Design and development of web applications are my main skills, and I'm also familiar with mobile development.

I love to work with TypeScript and Java and this is why I chose Nova Reply.

While working for my previous employer, I created some pretty Python scripts which integrate with the <Href href="htpps://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli">Salesforce CLI</Href> and I've also published my own <Href href="https://github.com/Astisme/again-why-salesforce">browser extension</Href>.

## What are you learning?
I'm studying Go, Docker and Kubernetes for my employment.

During my free time, I like to experiment with new technologies and frameworks, and I'm currently working on this very website with <Href href="https://astro.build">Astro</Href>.

I also like to learn more about myself and how to live my best life with my girlfriend.

## What are your hobbies?
I'm planning to travel to Japan in the near future and I want to be able to communicate with the locals; so obviously, I'm studying Japanese on my own with lectures and books I find online.

I like reading self improvement books and I'm currently reading <Href href="https://www.amazon.it/dp/8817193089/">Amori tossici</Href> by Dr. Laura Pigozzi.

I've written a password journal for my grandparents and published it <Href href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCCHQ2FZ">independently on Amazon</Href>

## Which languages do you speak?

I'm a native Italian speaker and I'm fluent in English.

I'm currently studying Japanese and I'm able to read and write Hiragana and Katakana, but I'm still learning Kanji. I still have a lot of work to do.

In order to accomplish this goal, I've acquired the following resources:
- <Href href="https://www.amazon.it/Minna-No-Nihongo-Beginner-2nd/dp/4883196038/">Minna no Nihongo</Href> which teaches Japanese in Japanese
- <Href href="https://www.amazon.it/Genki-Vol-1-Textbook-3e-ed/dp/4789017303/">Genki 1</Href> which teaches it in English
- <Href href="https://www.amazon.it/Chikamichi-Giapponese-zero-giapponese-italiani-ebook/dp/B09Z9Q3CGL/">Chikamichi Giapponese da zero</Href> which teaches the language in Italian
