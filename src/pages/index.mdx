## Who are you?

I'm Alfredo, a software developer with a passion for web development and project design.

I've been asked to work as a Consultant at <Href href="https://www.reply.com/arlanis-reply/it/">Arlanis Reply</Href> right after the internship for the Bachelor's Degree at <Href href="https://www.uniupo.it/en">University of Eastern Piedmont</Href>.

I love to learn new things and to share my knowledge with others and I'm always looking for new challenges to improve myself so this is the reason why developing software is my job, but most importantly my lifestyle.

## What can you do?
I'm a full-stack developer, but I'm more focused on the backend side.

Design and development of web applications are my main skills, but I'm also familiar with mobile development.

I love to work with TypeScript and Java and this is the reason why I develop on <Href href="https://www.salesforce.com">Salesforce</Href> for my employer.


To automate the repetitive tasks of my workflow, I've started to create some pretty Python scripts which integrate with the <Href href="htpps://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli">Salesforce CLI</Href>

I'm studying for the <Href href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/users/strailhead/trailmixes/prepare-for-your-salesforce-platform-developer-i-credential">Salesforce Platform Developer I</Href> certification for work. 

During my free time, I like to experiment with new technologies and frameworks, and I'm currently working on this very website with the <Href href="https://astro.build">Astro</Href> framework.

## What are your hobbies?
I'm planning to move to Japan in the near future and I want to be able to communicate with the locals; so obviously, I'm studying Japanese on my own with lectures and books I find online.

I like reading self improvement books and I'm currently reading <Href href="https://www.amazon.it/No-More-Mr-Nice-Guy/dp/9391560407/">No More Mr. Nice Guy!</Href> by Dr. Robert A Glover.

I've written a password journal for my grandparents and published it <Href href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCCHQ2FZ">independently on Amazon</Href>

## Which languages do you speak?

I'm a native Italian speaker and I'm fluent in English.

I'm currently studying Japanese and I'm able to read and write Hiragana and Katakana, but I'm still learning Kanji. I still have a lot of work to do.

In order to accomplish this goal, I've acquired the following resources:
- <Href href="https://www.amazon.it/Minna-No-Nihongo-Beginner-2nd/dp/4883196038/">Minna no Nihongo</Href> which teaches Japanese in Japanese
- <Href href="https://www.amazon.it/Genki-Vol-1-Textbook-3e-ed/dp/4789017303/">Genki 1</Href> which teaches it in English
- <Href href="https://www.amazon.it/Chikamichi-Giapponese-zero-giapponese-italiani-ebook/dp/B09Z9Q3CGL/">Chikamichi Giapponese da zero</Href> which teaches the language in Italian
